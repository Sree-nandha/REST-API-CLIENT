*COMPANY*:CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME*:SREENANDHA K

*INTERN ID*:CT04DG2749

*DOMAIN*:JAVA PROGRAMMING

*DURATION*:4 WEEKS(25 JUNE 2025-25 JULY 2025)

*MENTOR*:NEELA SANTHOSH

*DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK*:The main objective of this task is to build a simple but functional Java application that consumes a public REST API and presents the fetched data in a structured format. This project focuses on understanding how external web services (APIs) can be accessed and processed within a Java program using HTTP requests and JSON parsing.

*TASK OVERVIEW*:
As part of the internship assignment, the task is to design a REST API Client using core Java, which connects to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather information for any city entered by the user. The application is expected to:

Accept input (city name) from the user

Construct an API URL using the city and API key

Send an HTTP GET request to the weather server

Receive the JSON response

Parse the response to extract key data like temperature, humidity, and weather condition

Display the result in a clean, readable format on the console

This project demonstrates integration between Java applications and modern RESTful APIs using real-time data.

*TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED*:

Programming Language: Java (JDK 11+)

Editor: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

JSON Parser: Jackson library (jackson-core, jackson-databind, jackson-annotations)

External API: OpenWeatherMap 

API Format: JSON

HTTP Client: Built-in HttpClient from java.net.http package
